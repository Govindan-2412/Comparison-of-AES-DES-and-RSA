# Comparison-of-AES-DES-and-RSA 
# Analsing which algorithm is best for message transferring

In recent years, many applications based on internet are developed such as on-line shopping, internet banking and electronic bill payment etc. Such transactions, over wire or wireless public networks demand end-to-end secure connections, should be private, to ensure data authentication, accountability and privacy, integrity and availability, also known as CIA triad

Algorithms

RSA has been used in most digital data, information and telephone security applications. The RSA has it's advantages of being a reliable and safe system but it also has the disadvantage of being very slow in data calculating. For this reason it is used in hybrid cryptographic systems that simultaneously use symmetric algorithms (AES) for the communication and data encryption phase and public key algorithms (RSA) for the safe delivery of the symmetric key (or session key) that is necessary for encrypting and decrypting the message. There are different levels of encryption in telephone cryptography
